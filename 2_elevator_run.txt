Sim step 0
Elevator requested on floor 0
Boarding passenger 1 in elevator 0 (on floor 0, desired destination 2, elevator direction stationary)
Boarding passenger 3 in elevator 0 (on floor 0, desired destination 2, elevator direction stationary)
Boarding passenger 2 in elevator 1 (on floor 0, desired destination 1, elevator direction stationary)
Elevator requested on floor 2
Elevator on floor 0 is stationary, picking stop 2
New direction up
Elevator 0 moved to floor 2
Elevator on floor 0 is stationary, picking stop 1
New direction up
Elevator 1 moved to floor 1
